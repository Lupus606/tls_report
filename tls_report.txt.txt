The website www.google.com uses a digital certificate issued by Google Trust Services (GTS Root R4). This certificate is valid from June 23, 2025, to September 15, 2025, and employs modern cryptographic algorithms such as elliptic curve cryptography with a 256-bit key and SHA256 for the digital signature. The certificate chain is complete and trusted, meaning the user can rely on it for secure communication. The server supports the latest versions of the TLS protocol, including TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2, and offers strong cipher suites such as TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, which provide both confidentiality and forward secrecy. Older protocols like SSL 2 and SSL 3 are disabled to enhance security. Additionally, Google’s server enforces HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), ensuring that browsers only connect over secure HTTPS and preventing downgrade attacks to less secure protocols. The server is also protected against well-known vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed and POODLE. Forward secrecy is implemented to ensure that even if the server’s long-term private key is compromised, past encrypted sessions remain secure. TLS protects against man-in-the-middle attacks by authenticating the server using a trusted certificate authority, which the client verifies before any sensitive data is exchanged. This verification ensures that the client is communicating with the genuine server, preventing impersonation by attackers. Furthermore, forward secrecy ensures that session keys cannot be reused or decrypted by attackers, even if they intercept the traffic. TLS secures online communications by performing a handshake between the client and server at the start of the connection. During this handshake, both parties negotiate the encryption algorithms and securely exchange keys. Once the handshake is complete, all subsequent data is encrypted, protecting sensitive information such as passwords and payment details from eavesdroppers. TLS also confirms the server’s identity to protect users from fraudulent websites that attempt to impersonate legitimate ones
